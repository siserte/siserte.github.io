<p>holds the degrees of BS in Computer Engineering (2011), MS in Intelligent Systems (2014), and Ph.D. in Computer Science (2018) from Universitat Jaume I (UJI), Spain.</p>

<p>He is a senior researcher in the <a href="https://www.bsc.es/discover-bsc/organisation/scientific-structure/accelerators-and-communications-hpc">Accelcom</a> research group, led by Dr. Antonio J. Peña, within the Computer Sciences Department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). In addition, Dr. Iserte teaches high-performance computing (HPC) at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC) and artificial intelligence (AI) at the International University of Catalonia (UIC).</p>

<p>Dr. Iserte has authored 19 journal articles indexed in SJR, including seven in Q1 journals. He has actively contributed to multiple European and national research projects, as well as industrial collaborations—taking on roles such as work package coordinator. His academic service includes peer-reviewing over 60 papers and research proposals for ministries in Spain and Poland.</p>

<p>He has served on various scientific committees of leading HPC conferences, including the main supercomputing conference, SC, where he contributed to student programs, infrastructure, inclusivity, and security committees. He has also supervised visiting researchers, engineering staff, undergraduate and master’s theses, and Ph.D. students, reflecting his strong commitment to mentorship and academic growth. Currently, he is the lead guest editor of the special issue “HPC Heterogeneous Systems and Subsystems” in the journal Future Generation Computer Systems.</p>

<p>His research interests primarily include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallel distributed programming models</li>
<li>Dynamic processes and resources management</li>
<li>HPC workload modeling</li>
<li>In-network acceleration</li>
<li>Applied artificial intelligence in HPC</li>
</ul>
