<p>holds a B.S. in Computer Engineering (2011), an M.S. in Intelligent Systems (2014), and a Ph.D. in Computer Science (2018) from Universitat Jaume I (UJI), Spain.</p>

<p>He is currently a Senior Researcher in the Accelerators and Communications for HPC (<a href="https://www.bsc.es/discover-bsc/organisation/scientific-structure/accelerators-and-communications-hpc">Accelcom</a>)
 group, led by Dr. Antonio J. Peña, within the Computer Sciences Department at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). He also teaches High-Performance Computing (HPC) at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the International University of Catalonia (UIC).</p>

<p>Dr. Iserte’s research demonstrates a solid trajectory of independence, innovation, and impact. He has authored over 20 journal papers in Q1 journals and top-tier HPC conferences, including best paper awards. His work has advanced the fields of parallel programming models, dynamic resource management, in-network computing, and applied AI. He has played key roles in numerous European, national, and industrial projects, often as work package coordinator.</p>

<p>An active member of the international HPC community, Dr. Iserte has served on more than 20 scientific and organizational committees, including the main HPC conference (SC), serving on its technical, student, inclusivity, infrastructure, and security committees. He has reviewed over 200 scientific papers and research proposals and co-edited special issues for JPDC and FGCS. His mentorship record includes supervising visiting researchers, engineers, graduate students, and Ph.D. candidates.</p>

<p>His research interests primarily include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parallel distributed programming models</li>
<li>Dynamic heterogenous resource management</li>
<li>HPC workload modeling</li>
<li>In-network acceleration</li>
<li>Applied artificial intelligence</li>
</ul>
