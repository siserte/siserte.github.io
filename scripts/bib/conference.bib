	abstract = {This paper presents an efficient tool for managing dynamic resources in production high-performance computing (HPC) settings, focusing on flexibility, adaptability, and user-friendliness. We introduce a unified dynamic resource management application programming interface (API) that supports a wide range of HPC applications, allowing seamless integration without direct interaction with Dynamic Management of Resources (DMR). The DMR framework, evolved from the DMRlib structure, now supports various dynamic resource managers and includes the Proteo reconfiguration engine to enhance malleability strategies. This integration addresses previous limitations by allowing diverse reconfiguration methods without respawning all processes or lacking RMS support. The paper also showcases the solution’s performance and coding productivity with the MPDATA (Multidimensional Positive Definite Advection Transport Algorithm) application. Key contributions include an enhanced modular DMR framework supporting different reconfiguration managers, upgraded DMRlib with the Proteo reconfiguration engine, offering extensive reconfiguration strategies, and a malleable version of the MPDATA solver.},

	title = {Bridging the {Gap} {Between} {Genericity} and {Programmability} of {Dynamic} {Resources} in {HPC}},
	url = {https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018304},
	abstract = {Dynamic Resource Management (DRM) allows dynamically changing the resources assigned to a job during its execution. This flexibility can improve productivity in completed jobs per unit of time, resource utilization rate, and energy consumption, among other metrics. Despite its benefits, DRM remains complex to implement, which is one of the reasons it has not yet been widely adopted in production HPC systems. To address this challenge, we design, implement, and evaluate a methodology aimed at improving the programmability of DRM for iterative algorithm-based applications, while maintaining a generic and flexible foundation. Specifically, we interface the Dynamic Management of Resources API (DMR-API), an application-level abstraction layer that simplifies the adoption of dynamic resources—particularly in classical iteration-based HPC applications—with the Dynamic Processes with PSets (DPP) approach, which provides a set of generic design principles for dynamic resource management in high-performance parallel programming models. This integration makes DRM more accessible for iteration-based HPC applications through the DMR-API, while preserving the generality and flexibility of DPP at the system software level to support a wider range of HPC application types. Our results show that DRM can be effectively leveraged in HPC environments with minimal coding effort, unlocking the benefits of dynamic resource allocation for job throughput and system utilization.},
