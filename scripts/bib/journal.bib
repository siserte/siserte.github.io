	abstract = {Applying malleability to {HPC} systems can increase their productivity without degrading or even improving the performance of running applications. This paper presents Proteo, a configurable framework that allows to design benchmarks to study the effect of malleability on a system, and also incorporates malleability into a real application. Proteo consists of two modules: {SAM} allows to emulate the computational behavior of iterative scientific {MPI} applications, and {MaM} is able to reconfigure a job during execution, adjusting the number of processes, redistributing data, and resuming execution. An in-depth study of all the possibilities shows that Proteo is able to behave like a real malleable or non-malleable application in the range [0.85, 1.15]. Furthermore, the different methods defined in {MaM} for process management and data redistribution are analyzed, concluding that asynchronous malleability, where reconfiguration and application execution overlap, results in a 1.15\$\${\textbackslash}times\$\$speedup.},

	abstract = {Dynamic resource management is essential for optimizing computational efficiency in modern high-performance computing (HPC) environments, particularly as systems scale. While research has demonstrated the benefits of malleability in resource management systems (RMS), the adoption of such techniques in production environments remains limited due to challenges in standardization, interoperability, and usability. Addressing these gaps, this paper extends our prior work on the Dynamic Management of Resources (DMR) framework, which provides a modular and user-friendly approach to dynamic resource allocation. Building upon the original DMRlib reconfiguration runtime, this work integrates new methodology from the Malleability Module (MaM) of the Proteo framework, further enhancing reconfiguration capabilities with new spawning strategies and data redistribution methods. In this paper, we explore new malleability strategies in HPC dynamic workloads, such as merging MPI communicators and asynchronous reconfigurations, which offer new opportunities for dramatically reducing memory overhead. The proposed enhancements are rigorously evaluated on a world-class supercomputer, demonstrating improved resource utilization and workload efficiency. Results show that dynamic resource management can reduce the workload completion time by 40\% and increase the resource utilization by over 20\%, compared to static resource allocation.},

	abstract = {Forecasting influent flow in Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) is critical for managing operational risks during flash floods, especially in Spain’s Mediterranean coastal regions. These facilities, essential for public health and environmental protection, are vulnerable to abrupt inflow surges caused by heavy rainfall. This study proposes a data-driven approach combining historical flow and rainfall data to predict short-term inflow dynamics. Several models were evaluated, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LSTM, using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). XGBoost outperformed the others, particularly under severe class imbalance, with only 1\% of the data representing rainfall events. Hyperparameter tuning and input window size analysis revealed that accurate predictions are achievable with just 14 days of training data from a 10-year (2012–2022) dataset sourced from a single WWTP and on-site weather station. The proposed framework supports proactive WWTP management during extreme weather events.},

Although DRM has been extensively studied through analytical workloads and simulations, skepticism persists among end administrators and users regarding their feasibility under real-world conditions. To address this problem, we propose a novel methodology for validating DRM techniques, such as malleability, in realistic scenarios that reproduce actual cluster conditions of jobs and users by replaying workload logs on a High-performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. Our methodology is capable of adapting the workload to the target cluster. We evaluate our methodology in a malleability-enabled 125-node partition of the Marenostrum 5 supercomputer. Our results validate the proposed method and assess the benefits of MPI malleability on a novel use case of a pioneer user of malleability (our “PhD Student”): parallel-efficiency-aware malleability reduced a malleable workload time by 27\% without delaying the baseline workload, although introducing queueing delays for individual jobs, but maintaining the resource utilization rate.},
